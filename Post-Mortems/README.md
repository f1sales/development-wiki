## What is a Post Mortem?

"A post-mortem is where a team reflects on what went wrong with something they did, and documents it and/or amends their process to stop it happening again.

Did a software release go bad? Let's break down a timeline of where things started to go wrong, and let's reflect how we could have caught it earlier.

Here is the most important point: Post-mortems ARE NOT to assign blame. If we look at The Knight Capitol Group example, there should have been no way for one person to forget something and cripple the company.

Where was the quality assurance process where someone checked the technician's work? Did they test this before going to production? Were there no automatic tests that ran before the deploy to production succeeded?

You should be finding process failures not personal failures."
