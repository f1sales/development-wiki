# Development Wiki ðŸ–¥

This a guide for development best practices.


- English for everything! Code, commit messages, issues, tickets etc...
- Simplicity is key, avoid "overengineering", solve one problem at the time. 
- Test! if a piece of code will affect an end user it needs to be tested.
- Rely on tools to keep your code linted and according to a style guide.
- There's only one way of doing things: The right way.
- Remember: Single Responsibility and Do Not repeat Yourself
- Pull Request your work, two heads think better than one
- Commit and push your code at least once a day, anything can happen tomorrow.
